# DigiSpark-Wifi-Pass-Payload
This payload has been created for use with the "DigiSpark aTTiny85 USB Development Board" (buy links at bottom).
Essentially, this is a USB Rubber Ducky for less than $2. What this does, is it allows you to do is grab all cached wifi passwords on the 
Windows machine and sends it to your email in a matter of seconds. It uses Windows PowerShell and basic cmd with no interaction.
